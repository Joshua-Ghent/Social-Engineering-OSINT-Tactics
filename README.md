# Social Engineering & OSINT Tactics

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to understand how social engineering tactics can be used to conduct targeted attacks through open-source intelligence (OSINT), deception, and psychological manipulation. Students explored how to gather intelligence, design pretext attacks, and identify countermeasures, while also investigating vulnerabilities through simulated email phishing, data leaks, and blog mining.
